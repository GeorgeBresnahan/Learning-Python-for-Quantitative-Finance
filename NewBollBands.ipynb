    "## Channel Trading systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Market prices tend to flow in channels, like a river in their valleys. When a river touches the right edge of its valley, it turns left. When it touches the left rim of its valley it turns right.\n",
    "\n",
    "When prices rally, they often seem to stop at an invisible ceiling. Their declines seem to stop at invisible floors. Channels help us anticipate where their support and resistance levels are likely to be encountered. Support is where buyers buy with greater intensity than sellers sell. Resistance is where sellers sell with greater intesnity than buyers buy. Channels show where to expect support and resistance in the future. Channels help identify buying and selling opportunities and avoid bad trades. The late great mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot was hired by the Egyptian government to create a mathematical model of cotton prices - the main agricultural export of that country. After extensive study, the scientist made the finding, 'prices oscillate above and below a value' It may sound simple, but it is in fact profound. If we accept this mathematical finding and if we have the means to define value and measure an average oscillation, we'll have a trading system. We'll need to buy below value and take profits at value or sell short above value and cover at value. We have already agreed that value is in the zone between a short and a long moving average. We can use channels to find normal and abnormal oscillations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We construct a channel by plotting two lines parralel to a moving average, one above and another below. We may also vary the distance between the channel lines depending on that market's volatility (standard deviation channels). A symmetrical channel, centered around a moving average, is useful for trading stocks. A standard deviation channel (sometimes called Bollinger bands) is used also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Channels mark the boundaries between normal and abnormal price action. It is normal for prices to stay inside a well-drawn channel, and only unusual events push them outside. The market is undervalued below its lower channel line and overvalued above its upper channel line. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Market Psychology__\n",
    "\n",
    "An exponential moving average reflects the average consensus of value in its time window. When prices are near their moving average, the market is fairly valued. When they decline near the lower channel line, the market is undervalued. When prices rise to the upper channel line, the market is overvalued. Channels help find buying opportunities when the market is cheap and shorting opportunities when the market is dear. When prices fall below their moving average, bargain hunters step in. Their buying, as well as short covering by bears stops declines and lifts prices. When prices rise above value, sellers see an opportunity to take profits on long positions or go short, their selling caps the rise. When the market sinks to the bottom of a depression, its mood is about to improve. Once it rises to the height of its mania, it's about to start calming down. A channel marks normal limits of mass optimism and pessimism. The upper channel line shows where bulls run out of steam, while the lower channel line shows where bears become exhausted. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a rally shoots out of a channel and prices close above it, it shows that the uptrend is exceptionally strong. When a rall fails to reach the upper channel line, it is a bearish sign, as it shows that bulls are becoming weaker. The reverse applies to downtrends, whereby the downtrend is strong and failure of channel breakout is a bullish sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Standard Deviation Channels (Bollinger Bands)__\n",
    "\n",
    "The unique feature of these channels is that their width changes in response to market volatility. Their trading rules differ from those of regular channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Calculate a 21-day EMA (in this case period)\n",
    "2) Subtract the 21-day Ema from each closing price to obtain all the deviations from the average\n",
    "3) Square each of the deviations and sum to find the total squared deviations\n",
    "4) Divide the total squared deviation by the EMA length to obtain the average squared deviation. \n",
    "5) Take the square root of the average squared deviation to obtain the standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "A band becomes wider when the volatility increases but it narrows down when the volatility decreases. A narrow band identifies a quiet market. Bollinger bands help to identify transitions from quiet to active markets. "

    "One major issue in the original code was capturing accurate entry and exit prices after placing a trade. This was tricky because of the method used to extract these prices. At first, I tried using entry_price = trade.orderStatus.avgFillPrice, but ran into a problem. There’s usually a slight delay (about half a second) between when an order is placed and when it’s actually filled. This delay caused the entry price to register as zero, because the order hadn’t completed yet, meaning entry prices weren’t properly stored, and percentage returns couldn’t be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work around this, I first tried adding a half-second delay using ib.sleep() to give the trade time to fill. However, this approach conflicted with the asynchronous nature of the code, throwing off the process flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also attempted to use the asyncio package to better handle the delay, but I didn’t have enough familiarity with asynchronous loops and couldn’t get it to work that way.\n",

    "The best solution, which I plan to implement in live trading algorithms using IB_async, is to access the IB.fills list directly.
